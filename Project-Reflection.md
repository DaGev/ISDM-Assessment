**Project Reflection:**

Our team used the agile Scrum methodology throughout the report creation process, including the various UML diagrams. A big part of this was using the Github version control software. This helped us keep track of the various versions of the report, through branches, as well as storing the various historical versions of our report through commits. This allowed us to keep track of the work that had been done and whom it was done by. We combined the Scrum methodology with our use of Github in a very organised way. Here is how.

In the Scrum methodology, there are 3 roles: Product Owner, Scrum master, and the Development team.

- The Scrum master was Davit Gevorgyan and his role was to facilitate communication between the product owner and the development team by asking the necessary questions and developing them into use cases for the team to follow. As the Scrum master, he was also responsible for accepting the merge pull requests from other branches into the master branch on Github, as well as solving any merge conflicts that would arise.

- The development team consisted of Davit Gevorgyan, Maria Herrera, Sevag Keoshgerian and Aminul Islam Rafi. They were responsible for developing the items on the product backlog, which were represented in the “Issues” functionality on Github. After committing a certain task to the repository, the member of the dev team would mark the issue that was closed by it as “closed” and include the commit number in the closing comment of the issue. This made it easier for us to track down when anything was completed.

- The product owner was Muhammad Atif Qureshi, who answered the questions about the product and about the information system we are tasked with making.

The team also strictly followed the sprint system of the Scrum methodology. The sprints were 1 week long and we had tasks on the backlog which we had to complete each sprint. We had 3 prints in total, week 1, week 2 and week 3-4 (combined into one). The backlog items were the ones listed in the “Issues” section on Github, and strict allocation of who needed to do what wasn’t assigned since we worked on nearly all aspects of the report live on call as a group.
