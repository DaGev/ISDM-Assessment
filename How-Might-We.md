**'How Might We' statements**

1. How might we ensure that the criteria used for the RM selection will have the highest possible chance of connecting the customer to the most effective RM?
2. How might we balance the connection with the customer based on their likelihood to make a purchase (customer score) with the necessity of connecting him/her to the most effective RM?
3. How might we generate a script for the RM that will be most effective in achieving a sale in the call?
