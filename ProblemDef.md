**Problem Definition:**

To allocate Relationship Managers (RMs) to customers in the most efficient way possible, to achieve the greatest rate of sales per number of calls (for inbound and outbound calls), while reducing waiting times of customers (for inbound calls).

**POV Statement:**

1. As a customer, I want to talk to a representative who has a similar perspective, such as a common culture or language, so that I get the best possible product recommendation and purchase.
2. As a customer, I want to be connected to the RM with the highest likelihood of success as measured through a criteria.
3. As an RM, I want to be connected to the customer with the highest score possible because I want to maximise the likelihood of a successful sale.
4. As an RM, I want to be given customer personalised guidelines and a script based on all available information to help me improve the service.

Inbound:

1. As a customer, I want to be connected to a representative as quickly as possible to save time.
2. As a customer, I want minimal interaction with the Interactive Voice Response unit because while necessary, it is an annoying experience.
3. As a customer, I want to be connected to the representative that is most likely to be knowledgeable about the inquiry (e.g travel location) so they can more effectively assist me. (See Assumption 3).

Outbound:

1. As a customer, I only want to be contacted by the company for a recommendation of a product that I&#39;m likely to be interested in so as to avoid unnecessary calls. (See Assumption 1)
2. As a customer, I want to be contacted at a time when I am likely to be available for a conversation because otherwise I will be disturbed and won&#39;t be able to respond.
3. As a customer, I don&#39;t want to be contacted if I have repeatedly shown a lack of interest in purchasing a product. (See Assumption 2)
4. As an RM, I want my schedule of end-customer calls and estimated call durations to be based on my skill level and past performance to ensure that I can assist the maximum number of customers in the available time.
Assumptions: 
The system makes the proposed product of a customer based on the customer profile, which has the information needed to make said proposal.
The score of the customer is impacted (lowered) if they show a lack of interest in purchasing a product by hanging up, repeatedly declining a purchase, etc.
When inquiring about the reasons for the call, The Interactive Voice Response unit asks about travel location interests (e.g. continent) and the Automatic Call Distributor uses that information in its routing process to an appropriate RM.
The Call Management Center is only used for connecting calls to RMs (not customer support).
