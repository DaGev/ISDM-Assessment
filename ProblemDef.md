**Problem Definition:**

To allocate Relationship Managers (RMs) to customers in the most efficient way possible, to achieve the greatest rate of sales per number of calls (for inbound and outbound calls), while reducing waiting times of customers (for inbound calls).

**POV Statement:**

1. As a customer, I want to talk to a representative who has a similar perspective, such as a common culture or language, so that I get the best possible product recommendation and purchase.
2. As a customer, I want to be connected to the RM with the highest likelihood of success as measured through a criteria.
3. As an RM, I want to be connected to the customer with the highest score possible because I want to maximise the likelihood of a successful sale.
