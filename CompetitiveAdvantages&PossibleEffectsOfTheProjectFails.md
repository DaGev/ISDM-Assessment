**Competitive Advantages** 

1.	Automatic call Distributor and Interactive Voice Response unit retain customers (less dropped calls).
2.	More efficient communication between customer and RM (more customers are consulted with in the same time period)
3.	Providing script and guidelines allow the call center staff to understand and provide the customer with the correct information about their package or packages quickly and accurately to reduce call time. 
4.	The scoring system ensures that customers that are likely to purchase a package are served first therefore, it would increase the purchase to call ratio.
5.	The interactive voice response unitsâ€™ ability to acquire appropriate data from customers can reduce per-call handling time as well as reduce the waiting time for the customers where they are just listening to music, making the experience less irritating. 
6.	The initial RM profile which was created using a 10-minute questionnaire is updated constantly using their subsequent performance, this will ensure data accuracy which is important when matching them with the correct customers. 
7.	By allocating RMs with their target lists it makes tracing who the customers interacted with easier.

**Possible Effects of the Project Fails**

1.	Extended waiting times resulting in unhappy customers and bad reviews
2.	Decrease in staff as they would be displeased in working with an inadequate system
3.	Drop in incoming finances
4.	Corruption of RM and customer profiles, matching up RMs with incompatible Customers
5.	Incorrect scheduling of calls can disturb workflow and create confusion.
6.	Corruption of profiles
7.	Security standard for the database could be second rate, exhibiting vulnerability to both RM and customer private details
8.	Lack of information if the system cannot provide script and guidelines
