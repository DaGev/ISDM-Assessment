**Reflection:**

Many assumptions were made throughout the user story writing process. These assumptions were necessary for a functioning potential system but were not included in the project specification. There were 3 of these assumptions, and here are the descriptions of each one.

**Assumption 1** : The project specification tells us that the proposal for a product is generated using the customer&#39;s information but it does not tell us, in the case of insufficient information, the legitimacy of the recommendation, so the first assumption assumes that the system has all the information needed to make a legitimate recommendation.

**Assumption 2:** The project specification tells us that the customer has a score, that the score is determined by the customer&#39;s likelihood to purchase the product and it gives a few examples of things that would impact the score. This assumption states that the customer&#39;s expression of a lack of interest is used in the criteria for his/her score.

**Assumption 3:** The Interactive Voice Response unit, according to this assumption, asks among other things the travel destination the customer is interested in and the Automatic Call Distributor uses that information among the rest in its judgement of the most appropriate RM for the customer.
